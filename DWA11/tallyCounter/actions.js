// In Redux, actions are objects that describe what should happen in your application.
// They typically have a type property and may include additional data.
// Here, we define three action types: ADD, SUBTRACT, and RESET.

export const ADD = 'ADD';
export const SUBTRACT = 'SUBTRACT';
export const RESET = 'RESET';
