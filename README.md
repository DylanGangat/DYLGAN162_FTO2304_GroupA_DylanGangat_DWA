# DWA Structuring JavaScript

Welcome to my repository for the DWA module at Codespace Academy! In this module, I will be diving into the world of structuring JavaScript code for clean, maintainable, and scalable development. 

In this module, I'll be learning about:

- **Code Style**: Understanding and implementing consistent and readable coding practices.
- **Documentation**: Writing clear and effective documentation for better collaboration and understanding.
- **Error Handling**: Mastering techniques to handle errors and improve application reliability.
- **Abstraction**: Learning how to abstract complex functionalities into reusable components.
- **Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)**: Exploring the principles of OOP to design and manage code efficiently.
- **Functional Programming**: Leveraging functional programming concepts for cleaner and more modular code.
- **State Machines**: Understanding and implementing state machines for managing complex application states.

These skills will equip me with the tools to structure my JavaScript code effectively, making it easier to manage and maintain as I progress in my coding journey.
