# DWA Structuring JavaScript

Welcome to my repository for the DWA module at Codespace Academy! In this module, I will be diving into the world of structuring JavaScript code for clean, maintainable, and scalable development. 

In this module, I'll be learning about:

- Code Style
- Documentation
- Error Handling
- Abstraction
- Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)
- Functional Programming
- State Machines

These skills will equip me with the tools to structure my JavaScript code effectively, making it easier to manage and maintain as I progress in my coding journey.
